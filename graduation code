/* Create a subclass of Student called GraduateStudent. 
A graduate student should have an additional attribute called projectTitle, 
representing the title of their graduation project. Add the following methods to the GraduateStudent class:
getProjectTitle(): returns the project title of the graduate student.
setProjectTitle: sets the project title of the graduate student to the given projectTitle value

Finally, create an object of the GraduateStudent class and perform several operations such as getting and setting attributes,
 and invoking the getFirstName, getLastName, getAge, getEmail, getStudentId, 
 and getProjectTitle methods to ensure that all methods are working correctly. */
